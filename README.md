## Design Teardown Microverse Project

In this simple project, we'll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine called "Smashing Magazine". The goal for this exercise is to start training ourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Our job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For example, there is this image from vanseodesign.com which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Our final product will look much like the site we just showed.
