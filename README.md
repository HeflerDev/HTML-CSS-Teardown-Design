# Design Teardown Microverse Project

In this simple project, we'll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine called "[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)". The goal for this exercise is to start training ourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Our job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For example, there is this image from [vanseodesign.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20170628134444/http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/visual-hierarchy-compared.png) which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Our final product will look much like the site we just showed.
